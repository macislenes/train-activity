# train-activity

We are able to enter train first departure time as well as interval into a table and receive when the next train is expected and how long in minutes that is. 

This is useful when you are trying to look at a list of train schedules and decide which one will you get to your locations the fastes or most timely. 

When you load the page you have a blank table and input form
You will have several fields you can insert information into
    Train Name
    Destination
    First Train Time
    Interval
Once you have entered the information it will print it to the table
While populating the table it will calculate the time of the next one and the minutes until it arrives
